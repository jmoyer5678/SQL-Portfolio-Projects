This dataset might be storing budget and profit values in terms of a films native currency. When converting from Japanese Yen to USD, we get an average value of about 2.6 million which seems more reasonable. Regardless of which currencies are being displayed, we can see that most of the top countries are actually returning losses on average. Though it might be unfair to judge a nations film industry based on this data given the low sample size of films that are listed for some of these countries. Since the U.S. has a healthy number of films to work with, and we can be more confident of the currency units used, lets focus our analysis further on just American films when exploring which kinds of films are most successful.

The query above first categorizes each American film into equal thirds based on budget, then aggregates our metrics for each third. From this, we can see that while there is little difference in average rating between budget tiers, there are some opposite trends at play in terms of number of votes and percentage of films that return profit, with number of votes going up as budget increases and percentage of profitible films declining. Logically, this makes sense as a higher budget likely includes more marketing resources to drive public engagement. While lower budget films have less of hole to fill when it comes to generating a profit. It's also worth noting that the differences in average profits don't appear all that signficant, since higher budget films inherently have more risk given the larger dollar amounts they need to cover prior to even breaking even.
