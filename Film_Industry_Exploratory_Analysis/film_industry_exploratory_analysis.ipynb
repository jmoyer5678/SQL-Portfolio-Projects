The query above first categorizes each American film into equal thirds based on budget, then aggregates our metrics for each third. From this, we can see that while there is little difference in average rating between budget tiers, there are some opposite trends at play in terms of number of votes and percentage of films that return profit, with number of votes going up as budget increases and percentage of profitible films declining. Logically, this makes sense as a higher budget likely includes more marketing resources to drive public engagement. While lower budget films have less of hole to fill when it comes to generating a profit. It's also worth noting that the differences in average profits don't appear all that signficant, since higher budget films inherently have more risk given the larger dollar amounts they need to cover prior to even breaking even.

as well as rankings by these values within each role. From this, we can see that Christoper Nolan and Quentin Tarantino appear to be in a class of their own in regard to average IMDb rating. We can also see that some people are very successful both critically and commercially (eg. James Cameron: Ranks 3 and 2), while there are some who are great in one regard, but lacking a bit in the other (eg. Martin Scorsese: Ranks 6 and 117).","metadata":{},"cell_type":"markdown","id":"be0cf6fc-5e88-4e87-a4f7-a873051606ce"},{"source":"## Conclusion\n\nWith this data, we were able to assess films based off of a number of metrics (profit generated, IMDb score, number of votes, number of Facebook Likes), and also categorize films into different groupings to see which kinds of films performed the best (country, certification/rating, budget tier). Then we broke down films into decade of release and see how scores, budgets, profits, movie lenghts, and frequency of certifications changed over time. Finally, by utilizing two new tables, we were able to rank both actors and directors by the average scores and profits generated by their films.
